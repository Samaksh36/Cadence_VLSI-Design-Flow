### Abstract: RTL to GDS via Cadence Tools 


### Tools
Cadence Simvision and IMC: RTL simulation and Code Coverage via Test Bench
Cadence Genus: Logic Synthesis
Cadence Conformal: Equivalence Checking
Cadence Tempus: Static Timing Analysis
Cadence Innovus: Physical Design

The idea is to begin with a logic block, and write its equivalent RTL module. We are using Verilog to describe the hardware.

We would be implementing the following logic block: -
If C=8’h00 TO 8’h59, 4-bit ring counter
C=8’h78 TO 8’h90, 4x1 Mux
C=8’hB1 TO 8’hED, frequency divider by 8
Else, bitwise A OR B
